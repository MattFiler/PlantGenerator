This project is an implementation of a plant model editor in DirectX11. Plant model parts are loaded from a configuration file, and able to be positioned and tweaked by users.

When editing has finished, the resulting model can be saved out to disk, with options for high/medium/low poly versions.

The default configuration includes editors for plants and grass, however can be expanded to suit requirements.
